## ü§ñ Auto Outfit Updates

<div align="center">
  <img width="766" height="789" alt="Auto Outfit Feature Screenshot" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/322f485e-75bf-494c-ae71-f5201d16c1b0" />
</div>

Auto Outfit Updates is an optional feature that you can enable from Extension Settings.

When enabled, after every character response, system will perform a check and automatically wear, remove or change item
slots based on what happened in last messages.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Keep in mind that the results of this feature completely depends on how smart the AI you are using is. If you are
> using
> an old, small, less smart model, AI may make mistakes and wear/remove things when it shouldn't.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Also since it performs a check after every message, you should have a decent generation speed if you don't want to
> wait
> too much between messages.

#### üí° Tips:

- Make sure you wait for the check to finish before you say something to AI.
- AI can wear/remove/change multiple items in one turn.
- In Extension Settings window you can see the prompt system uses for performing self-check. If you don't know what
  you are doing, please don't change this.

## üì§ Import Outfit from Character Card (Experimental)

The `/import-outfit` command is a powerful feature that uses LLM analysis to automatically extract outfit information
from your character card. This command will:

1. üîç Analyze character description, personality, scenario, and character notes
2. üëï Identify clothing and accessories mentioned in the text
3. üì¶ Populate the outfit tracker with these items using appropriate commands
4. üßπ Clean up the original character card by removing clothing references
5. ‚úÖ Fix spelling and grammar errors during the cleanup process

This is especially useful when importing characters that already have outfit descriptions in their character card.

## üåê Connection Profile Support (Experimental)

The auto outfit system now supports using different connection profiles for LLM generation. In the settings, you can
specify a connection profile (like OpenRouter, Oobabooga, OpenAI, or Claude) that will be used specifically for auto
outfit detection. This allows you to use a different model for outfit detection than for your main conversation if
desired.

## üîå Automatic Outfit Context Injection

The Outfit Tracker automatically injects current outfit information into the conversation context, so you don't need to
manually add variables to your character card. The system intelligently includes outfit information only when outfits
are actually set (non-empty), automatically removing sections that contain no clothing or accessories.

The extension uses SillyTavern's `generate_interceptor` to automatically add outfit information at the appropriate
position in the conversation context. When outfits are set, they appear in the context like this:

```
**<BOT>'s Current Outfit**
**Headwear:** Red Baseball Cap
**Topwear:** Blue T-Shirt
**Bottomwear:** Black Jeans

**<BOT>'s Current Accessories**
**Neck Accessory:** Gold Chain
**Hands Accessory:** Leather Gloves

**{{user}}'s Current Outfit**
**Headwear:** White Sun Hat
**Topwear:** Summer Dress

**{{user}}'s Current Accessories**
**Neck Accessory:** Silver Pendant
```

> üí° **This injection happens automatically** - no need to add any variables to your character card unless you want to
> reference them elsewhere in your prompt.

## üè∑Ô∏è Custom Macro System (Advanced)

The extension now uses a custom macro system that replaces the legacy global variable approach. Instead of using
`{{getglobalvar::<BOT>_slot}}` format, the system registers custom macros that can be used directly in prompts and
character cards.

### Basic Macros

| Macro      | Description              |
|------------|--------------------------|
| `{{char}}` | Current character's name |
| `{{user}}` | Current user's name      |

### Outfit Slot Macros

The system dynamically registers outfit slot macros for both the current character and user. Each slot can be referenced
using the format `{{prefix_slot}}`:

### Development Setup

1. Clone the repository to your SillyTavern extensions directory
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Make changes to the source files in the `/src` directory
4. Use `npm run lint` to check code quality
5. Use `npm test` to run tests

### üß™ Testing

The project includes a comprehensive testing suite using Jest. The tests handle the
browser-dependent nature of the SillyTavern extension:

- ‚úÖ Tests for utility functions (validation, string processing)
- ‚úÖ Tests for the Outfit Store state management system
- ‚úÖ Mock-based tests for extension initialization
- ‚úÖ Jest configuration with jsdom environment
